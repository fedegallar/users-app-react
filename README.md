# React with redux.

If we want to save states in a global level on a react application without using props to communicate information between components (father, son and siblings), we can use Redux.
With Redux we can create a store to save information in a global level and it can be read from any component. We have to define what actions are we going to consider (push a button, write an element, delete an element, change an url) and then we need to materialize that actions in reducers that we will call them anywhere and any time. Finally, we have to save those states in a store with their respective values so we can access them in any component.
